## Background

***

Throughout all of sports, it is widely believed that home teams have an advantage over visiting teams. Factors that lead to this advantage can include the comfort of playing at home, rather than travelling, fans creating an uplifting environment for the home team, and the referees giving the home teams the benefit of the doubt when making decisions. In this project, I will use games from the 2017 season to the 2021 season to explore which statistics help increase the winning percentage of home teams.

***

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("unnamed-chunk-1-1.png")
nba2017_21 <- nba2017_21 %>%
  select(Team, Result, Points_For, Points_Against, Home, FG_Per_For, Threes_Per_For, FT_Per_For, Rebounds_For, Assists_For, FG_Per_Against, Threes_Per_Against, FT_Per_Against, Rebounds_Against, Assists_Against) %>%
  filter(Result != "TBD",
         FG_Per_For > 0 & FG_Per_For < 0.707,
         Threes_Per_For > 0,
         FT_Per_For > 0.176,
         Rebounds_For > 0,
         Assists_For > 0) %>%
  mutate(Location = case_when(
    Home == 1 ~ "Home",
    Home == 0 ~ "Away"
  ),
  Outcome = case_when(
    Result == "W" ~ "Win",
    Result == "L" ~ "Loss"
  ))

graph1 <- nba2017_21 %>%
  select(Location, Outcome)%>%
  group_by(Location)%>%
  filter(Outcome == "Win")

ggplot(graph1, aes(x = Location))+
  geom_bar()+
  ylab("Number of Wins")+
  ggtitle("Number of Wins Based on Location")
```

***

From this graph, it is clear that the home team tends to win more often than the away team, at a rate of approximately 57.2%. Although this helps demonstrate the existence and effectiveness of home court advantage, I plan on looking more in depth on what statistics specifically contribute to this advantage.

## Variables Comparison

***

When looking at the most common statistics recorded and referenced in the game of basketball, the home team tends to have higher averages in every category, with free throw percentage being approximately the same regardless of being the home or away team.

***

**Variable Averages**

| Variable               |   Home    |    Away   |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Points Scored per Game | 110.0619  | 107.3165  |
| Assists per Game       | 22.72457  | 21.60336  |
| Rebounds per Game      | 53.00736  |  51.70649 |
| Field Goal Percentage  | 0.4782582 | 0.4683032 |
| Three Point Percentage | 0.3609404 | 0.3506443 |
| Free Throw Percentage  | 0.7356284 | 0.7358135 |

***

Comparing variables such as assists, rebounds, field goal percentage, three point percentage, and free throw percentage to points scored allows me to determine the levels of correlation between these variables and overall scoring. As seen in the chart below, there appears to be a relatively strong correlation between assists and points scored, as well as field goal percentage and points scored. The highest correlation was between three point percentage and scoring, which makes sense because the three point shot is the highest valued shot in basketball. On the other hand, free throw percentage had a low correlation with points scored, as it is the lowest valued shot in the game. The lowest correlated variable with scoring was rebounds, with a coefficient of approximately 0.126.

## Variables Difference Comparison

***

Although the correlation of the aforementioned variables to the amount of points scored highlights the influence that each variable has on scoring, this doesn't directly demonstrate an influence on which team wins the game. However, calculating the correlation between the difference in each variable between the home and away team and the difference in points scored between the home and away team offers a better understanding on how each variable effects the outcome of the game. Similar to the previous comparison, of the observed variables, differences in rebounds and free throw percentages have less of a correlation to the outcome of the game than other variables. Differences in assists and three point percentages all had higher correlation coefficients, which means teams that recorded more assists and shot better from behind the arc tended to have higher positive point differentials. The difference in field goal percentage had the strongest correlation to the difference in points scored, with a coefficient of approximately 0.651. This makes sense, as it logically makes sense that the team that shoots the ball better overall will tend to have a higher point differential against the opposing team.

## Drawbacks and Shortcomings of my Analysis

***

Although I utilized data from thousands of NBA games over several seasons, one limitation of my analysis is that this is a relatively small sample size compared to the entire history of the NBA. Increasing the sample size of my data would provide more accurate analysis on which variables effect home court advantage. Furthermore, another drawback of my analysis was that a small percentage of the games that I used occurred during the NBA bubble, in which games played between July 22, 2020 and October 11, 2020 were played behind closed doors due to the COVID pandemic. Although there was the virtual presence of fans on large monitors, the circumstances were not the same as the rest of the games used. Despite teams being assigned home games, in which a majority of the fans for the home team were displayed on the monitor, it is difficult to analyze the effectiveness of playing at home due to the differing circumstances. 

***

## Conclusion

***

Based on the previously calculated correlations that depict both the impact of each variable on not only scoring but the overall outcome of the game, field goal percentage and three point percentage appear to be the biggest factors contributing to home court advantage. I expected this result because the modernization of the game has caused teams to rely more heavily on shooting the ball at a more efficient rate. I expected free throw percentage to contribute more to home court advantage due to it being a scoring-related statistic, however, free throws only being worth one point caused this variable to have less of an effect that I thought. Rebounds having the least effect on home court advantage does not surprise me, as this variable relates to defense more than offense. Overall, I can conclude that shooting the ball more efficiently than their opponent is the main reason why home teams tend to win more often than away teams.
